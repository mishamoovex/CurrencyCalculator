## Hello dear colleague. I'll hope you are doing well. I decided to follow your advice from "Motivation of Code Tests" and spent more time on coding rather than in the interviewing later. I'll hope you'll enjoy it.

 I want to add a few notes about the test challenge:

- There wasn't any UI attached to the task and I decided to use the most straightforward UI possible because it wasn't the aim of the challenge.
- I worked with currencies as with regular numbers. It's not a proper way to do such calculations but it wasn't in the requirements and I decided to simplify development.
- I didn't find any requirements for automated tests, but I decided to add a few of them to show you that it matters for software development. You can find them inside the [:common](https://github.com/mishamoovex/CurrencyCalculator/tree/master/core/common/src/test/java/com/mykhailo/vasylenko/common) module in the "test" source set folder.



## I used a lot of advanced development concepts in this code challenge because it is a regular way how I built large distributed android applications.

- Language: Kotlin, Coroutines, Flow
- Architecture: Multimodule + Single Activity + MVVM + UDF + Clean architecture
- Jetpack Components: Lifecycle, SplashAPI, NavigationCompose, NavigationResult API
- UI: Jetpack Compose + Custom design system
- HTTP: Retrofit2, OkHttp, Interceptors, HTTP Logging, Moshi
- Data storage: Room, DataStore API
- Dependency Injection: Hilt
- Testing: Junit5, Mokk, Kottest

# The project was built using Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 Patch 1
# You should launched it using emulated device with API 33+
